Feature: Addition
  In order to avoid silly mistakes
  As someone who has trouble with mental math
  I want to be told the sum of two numbers

  Scenario Outline: Add two numbers
    Given I have entered <input_1> into the calculator
    And I have entered <input_2> into the calculator
    When I press <button>
    Then the result should be <output> on the screen

  Examples:
    | input_1 | input_2 | button | output |
    | 20      | 30      | add    | 50     |
    | 2       | 5       | add    | 7      |
    | 0       | 40      | add    | 40     |

  Scenario: Code samples
    Given I have some code examples
    """ruby
    class Calculator
      def multiply(x, y)
        x * y
      end
    end
    """
    And I have some code examples
    """rust
    fn safe_divide(x: f64, y: f64) -> Result<f64, &'static str> {
        match y {
            0.0 => Err("Division by zero"),
            _ => Ok(x / y),
        }
    }
    """
    And I have some code examples
