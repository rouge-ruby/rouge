# PDF = Portable Document Format page description language
# As defined by ISO 32000-2:2020 including resolved errata from https://pdf-issues.pdfa.org/
#
# The PDF syntax is also known as "COS" and can be used with FDF (Forms Data Field) files as
# per ISO 32000-2:2020 clause 12.7.8. 
#
# This is a token-based parser ONLY! It is intended to syntax highlight full or partial fragments 
# of nicely written hand-writteen PDF syntax in documentation such as ISO specifications. It is NOT
# intended to cope with real-world PDFs that will contain arbitrary binary data (that form invalid
# UTF-8 sequences and generate "ArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8" Ruby errors) and 
# other types of malformations or syntax errors.
