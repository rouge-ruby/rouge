 # Rouge
 
-This project is not yet finished, but this works:
+This project needs your help!  There are lots of lexers to be implemented / ported / fixed, and features that need to be added or implemented.  If you'd like to help out, send me a pull request (even if it's not done yet!).  Bonus points for feature branches.
+
+## Usage
 
 ``` ruby
-formatter = Rouge::Formatters::HTML.new
+# make some nice lexed html, compatible with pygments stylesheets
!formatter = Rouge::Formatters::HTML.new(:css_class => '.highlight')
 Rouge.highlight(File.read('/etc/bash.bashrc'), 'shell', formatter)
+
+# apply a theme
+Rouge::Themes::ThankfulEyes.new(:scope => '.highlight').render
 ```
 
-More features, documentation, lexers, and formatters to come.  Help is appreciated, too, if you think this is awesome :)
+Rouge aims to be simple to extend, and to be a drop-in replacement pygments, with the same quality of output.
+
+### Advantages to pygments.rb
