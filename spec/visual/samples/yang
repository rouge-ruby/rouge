  description
    "This module defines an interface for managing alarms.  Main
     inputs to the module design are the 3GPP Alarm Integration
     Reference Point (IRP), ITU-T X.733, and ANSI/ISA-18.2 alarm
     standards.
     Main features of this module include:

       * Alarm list:
                 A list of all alarms.  Cleared alarms stay in
                 the list until explicitly purged.

       * Operator actions on alarms:
                 Acknowledging and closing alarms.

       * Administrative actions on alarms:
                 Purging alarms from the list according to specific
                 criteria.

       * Alarm inventory:
                 A management application can read all
                 alarm types implemented by the system.

       * Alarm shelving:
                 Shelving (blocking) alarms according
                 to specific criteria.

       * Alarm profiles:
                 A management system can attach further
                 information to alarm types, for example,
                 overriding system-default severity
                 levels.

     This module uses a stateful view on alarms.  An alarm is a state
     for a specific resource (note that an alarm is not a
     notification).  An alarm type is a possible alarm state for a
     resource.  For example, the tuple:

       ('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25')

     is an alarm of type 'link-alarm' on the resource
     'GigabitEthernet0/25'.

     Alarm types are identified using YANG identities and an optional
     string-based qualifier.  The string-based qualifier allows for
     dynamic extension of the statically defined alarm types.  Alarm
     types identify a possible alarm state and not the individual
     notifications.  For example, the traditional 'link-down' and
     'link-up' notifications are two notifications referring to the
     same alarm type 'link-alarm'.

     With this design, there is no ambiguity about how alarm and
     alarm clear correlation should be performed; notifications that
     report the same resource and alarm type are considered updates
     of the same alarm, e.g., clearing an active alarm or changing
     the severity of an alarm.  The instrumentation can update the
     severity and alarm text on an existing alarm.  The above alarm
     example can therefore look like the following:

       (('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25'),
        warning,
        'interface down while interface admin state is up')

     There is a clear separation between updates on the alarm from
     the underlying resource, like clear, and updates from an
     operator, like acknowledging or closing an alarm:

       (('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25'),
        warning,
        'interface down while interface admin state is up',
        cleared,
        closed)

     Administrative actions like removing closed alarms older than a
     given time is supported.

     This YANG module does not define how the underlying
     instrumentation detects and clears the specific alarms.  That
     belongs to the Standards Development Organization (SDO) or
     enterprise that owns that specific technology.

     The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL
     NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED',
     'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as
     described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119) (RFC 8174) when, and only when,
     they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

       If the alarming resource is modeled in YANG, this type will
       be an instance-identifier.

       If the resource is an SNMP object, the type will be an

       If the resource is anything else, for example, a distinguished
       name or a Common Information Model (CIM) path, this type will
       be a string.

       If the alarming object is identified by a Universally Unique
       Identifier (UUID), use the uuid type.  Be cautious when using
       this type, since a UUID is hard to use for an operator.

      "This type is used to match resources of type 'resource'.
       Since the type 'resource' is a union of different types, the
       'resource-match' type is also a union of corresponding types.

       If the type is given as an XPath 1.0 expression, a resource
       of type 'instance-identifier' matches if the instance is part
       of the node set that is the result of evaluating the XPath 1.0
       expression.  For example, the XPath 1.0 expression:

        /ietf-interfaces:interfaces/ietf-interfaces:interface
            [ietf-interfaces:type='ianaift:ethernetCsmacd']

       would match the resource instance-identifier:

        /if:interfaces/if:interface[if:name='eth1'],

       assuming that the interface 'eth1' is of type
       'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd'.

       If the type is given as an object identifier, a resource of
       type 'object-identifier' matches if the match object
       identifier is a prefix of the resource's object identifier.
       For example, the value:

        1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2

       would match the resource object identifier:

        1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.5

       If the type is given as an UUID or a string, it is interpreted
       as an XML Schema regular expression, which matches a resource
       of type 'yang:uuid' or 'string' if the given regular
       expression matches the resource string.

       If the type is given as an XPath expression, it is evaluated
       in the following XPath context:

         o  The set of namespace declarations is the set of prefix
            and namespace pairs for all YANG modules implemented by
            the server, where the prefix is the YANG module name and
            the namespace is as defined by the 'namespace' statement
            in the YANG module.

            If a leaf of this type is encoded in XML, all namespace
            declarations in scope on the leaf element are added to
            the set of namespace declarations.  If a prefix found in
            the XML is already present in the set of namespace
            declarations, the namespace in the XML is used.

         o  The set of variable bindings is empty.

         o  The function library is the core function library, and
            the functions are defined in Section 10 of RFC 7950.
